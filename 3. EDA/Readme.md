<!--    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to
maximize insight into a data set;
uncover underlying structure;
extract important variables;
detect outliers and anomalies;
test underlying assumptions;
develop parsimonious models; and
determine optimal factor settings. -->

<!-- EDA involves generating summary statistics for numerical data in the dataset and creating various graphical representations to understand the data better.  -->
